#  A/B Hypothesis Test Analysis

## Summmary 
This report aims to describe in detail the findings of A/B hypothesis test which was designed to compare the two versions of webpage. The new version of webpage has been created to increase awareness about newly introduced food and drink offerings. The objective of this action is to increase revenue. The test involves addition of banner of products in food and drink category at the top of website.

### 1. Test parameters
To assess the potential impact of the new webpage design, I'll examine the following variables:

-	Conversion rate
If the user makes one or more purchases after joining the experiment, it would be considered as conversion. 

-	Amount Spent
Average amount spent by users from both group is considered to investigate whether new web design contributes to increase in revenue or not?
Analysis
The hypothesis testing A/B and confidence interval calculation will be performed on both variables conversion rate and amount spent. 

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
