#  A/B Hypothesis Test Analysis

## Summmary 
This report aims to describe in detail the findings of A/B hypothesis test which was designed to compare the two versions of webpage. The new version of webpage has been created to increase awareness about newly introduced food and drink offerings. The objective of this action is to increase revenue. The test involves addition of banner of products in food and drink category at the top of website.
The way control and treatment group will see the webpage is shown below:

Users will be randomly assigned to both groups.  

### Data
To extract GloBox data, we made an SQL query and subsequently conducted analysis using Google Sheets and Tableau. The query and associated tasks in Google Sheets can be found appended to the conclusion of this document. We examined the following variables:
- User id
-	Country
-	Average amount spent
<p align = "center" width="100%">
<img src="images/Project1/Data_image_amount_spent_by_gender_2.jpg?raw=true" width="500" height="400" />
<img src="images/Project1/Data_image_amount_spent_by_device_3.jpg?raw=true" width="500" height="400" />
</p>

-	Gender
<p align = "center" width="100%">
  <img src="images/Project1/Total_users_by_gender_4.jpg?raw=true" width="400" height="300" />
</p>

-	Device
<p align = "center" width="100%">
<img src="images/Project1/Total_users_by_device_5.jpg?raw=true" width="400" height="300" />
</p>

- Group
<p align = "center" width="100%">
<img src="images/Project1/Total_users_by_group_6.jpg?raw=true" width="400" height="300" />
</p>

-	Converted Users
<p align = "center" width="100%">

</p>


### 1. Test parameters
To assess the potential impact of the new webpage design, I'll examine the following variables:

-	Conversion rate
If the user makes one or more purchases after joining the experiment, it would be considered as conversion. 

-	Amount Spent
Average amount spent by users from both group is considered to investigate whether new web design contributes to increase in revenue or not?
Analysis
The hypothesis testing A/B and confidence interval calculation will be performed on both variables conversion rate and amount spent. 

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
